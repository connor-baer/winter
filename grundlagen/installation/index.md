<p class="message">The UWC WordPress theme can only be installed on self-hosted WordPress installations and not on sites that are hosted on wordpress.com.</p>

# Install the GitHub Updater plugin

The UWC WordPress theme is not listed publicly on wordpress.org. Therefore you have to install the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin first to install the theme and receive future updates.

1. Follow the instructions in the [readme](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater#upload) file to install the plugin, then come back here.

2. In WordPress, navigate to 'Settings' > 'GitHub Updater', then select 'Install Theme' from the tabs at the top.
Paste the url https://github.com/uwc/uwc-website into the field 'Theme URI'. You can leave the other fields as they are and click on the 'Install Theme' button.

3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
