## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm` also works) installed on our computer. Winter provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup ‚Äî just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```

Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Options

Winter shines with a simple & intuitive interface, multi-language support, and full content search. It includes some customizable options, applied via options in the `_config.yml` file. Have a look at the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file for all available options.

## Contributing

**This theme is no longer actively maintained.** However, I welcome bug fixes and feature request through [pull requests](https://github.com/connor-baer/winter/compare). If you don't feel comfortable making code changes, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/connor-baer/winter/issues/new), perhaps somebody else will help out.
